## 💡 What I learned

### C++

This was one of my first C++ and OpenGL projects, so quite a lot.

### CMake

Their was an attempt at using CMake, maybe in a future project.

### Mandelbrot

I had to read through a couple wikipedia articles to learn about implementing the mandelbrot fractal.
I used their _"smoothing function"_: 

```glsl
float log_zn = log(Z.x*Z.x + Z.y*Z.y) / 2.0;

float nu = log(log_zn / log(2.0)) / log(2.0);

iteration += 1.0 - nu;

color = vec4(mix(colormap[int(floor(iteration)) % 17], colormap[(int(floor(iteration)) + 1) % 17], fract(iteration)), 1.0);
```
